## About this port

The official repository or rather website of Let There Be Light can be found on [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/letthebelight/).

The goal of this port are the following:

* Keep as much as possible of the history.
* Bring the code base up to speed with the latest version of SFML.
* Add support for CMake to have a solid build system.
* Provide a place to collaborate.

## Features

* Physically accurate soft shadows
* Quad tree scene graph
* Light texture caching
* Emissive lights
* Light beams
* Directional lights
* Adjustable light color, attenuation, spread, source size, cone angle, bloom, and cone edge softness
* Ambient light setting
* Extendable light shape rendering
* Light bloom rendering

## Usage

Checkout the official but over time slightly outdated [documentation](doc/manual.pdf) in the Git repository to understand how Let There Be Light should be used.

Refer to the example code in the [example](example/) directory to learn how to use Let There Be Light.

## In Action

Let There Be Light has first been used in [Gore Factor](http://gorefactor.sourceforge.net/) ([SFML forum](http://en.sfml-dev.org/forums/index.php?topic=4604.0)), but by now it's used in one or the other way by a number of other games.
